# Sokoban

Sokoban is  a classic top-down puzzle game where the player, a "warehouse keeper" (sokoban), must push crates to designated storage locations on a grid-based warehouse floor. The core rules are that you can only push boxes (never pull them), and you can only push one box at a time. These simple rules create complex, challenging puzzles that require careful planning, as players can get their boxes into irreversible positions.

This version is a port of [XSokoban](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/xsokoban.html) to the Apple IIGS using the [iigs-game-engine](https://github.com/lscharen/iigs-game-engine) Tool160 by Lucas Scharenbroich. My goal was to famliarize myself with Tool160 and not to try and revitalize a video game first released in 1989.

To play Sokoban copy the application (disk image or archive) to your apple iiGS (real hardware) or emulated iiGS (Kegs based, or whatever you prefer).  Launch the Sokoban application. 

Movement is done using h (left), j (up), k (down) and l (right) or you may also use the arrow keys. You may run across the screen by pressing the control key along with a direction key. You can also run and push the object by pressing the shift key along with a direction key. 

Press the ? key in game to get a list of all the commands.
